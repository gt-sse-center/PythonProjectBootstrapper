  name cannot be associated with any other project on PyPI.

gist_id: |-
  Please enter the GitHub gist id for use with this project.

  GitHub defines a gist as "a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others." The generated
  python project will use a gist to store information dynamically generated during the build (for
  example code coverage information) that can be retrieved at a later time (for example, to display
  a code coverage badge in the project's README.md file).

  To create a gist:
      1. Go to https://gist.github.com/
      2. Enter the following values in their respective fields:

          Gist description...:                Gist used by GitHub Action workflows to store and retrieve dynamic information (oftentimes used to create and display badges).
          Filename including extension...:    README.md
          File contents:                      Gist used by GitHub Action workflows to store and retrieve dynamic information (oftentimes used to create and display badges).

      3. Click the "Create secret gist" button
      4. Copy the gist id (this will be the hex string at the end of the url associated with the gist
         that was just created). It will look something like:

            https://gist.github.com/<github username>/4c10281ff1abc26cafcb9a5f9a8a443e
                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                             This is the gist id
gist_username: |-
  Please enter the username associated with your gist_id. In most cases, this will be the same as your GitHub username.

create_docker_image: |-
  Would you like the GitHub Action workflows to create docker images of the development environment?
  These images can be used to produce exact results across different commits made to the repository
  over time (which is especially valuable when writing scientific software).
